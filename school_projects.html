        <p class="group_projects">
            In this project I and three other developers had the goal to create a step tracking game for Android. The
            idea was not only to encourage walking
            by making a game of it, but also learning how to develop for Android platforms. The game theme was that the
            user was pushing a lawnmower and each step went towards progress
            on mowing a lawn. The lawns would get progressively bigger but the user could purchase upgrades with money
            earned for completing lawns.
