        <h2>309: Step tracking game</h2>

        <p id="group_projects">
            In this project I and three other developers had the goal to create a step tracking game for Android. The
            idea was not only to encourage walking
            by making a game of it, but also learning how to develop for Android platforms. The game theme was that the
            user was pushing a lawnmower and each step went towards progress
            on mowing a lawn. The lawns would get progressively bigger but the user could purchase upgrades with money
            earned for completing lawns.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Team size:
            <br>3 (the fourth guy disappeared after the first month and as not been heard from since)
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            My role:<br> I was largely in charge of server communication. I used Volley to transfer user info to our
            database
            along with communicating friend requests to and from the user.
            I also had a share in creating the screens and simple navigation. I created a screen that took the history
            of
            the user's walking and displayed it in a bar graph. Lastly I worked
            with our main dev to create the architecture and game logic.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Technologies used:<br> Android, SQL, PHP, Volley, Android Studios, Genymotion Android Emulator, Trello, and
            Moqup.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            What I learned:<br>I had previously only had experience in Java. I had never been on a development team or
            had
            any
            experience in architecture design. In this project I learned a lot
            about all of that along with all of the technologies listed. I learned about project flow, Agile development
            and
            what it takes to create a functional application.
