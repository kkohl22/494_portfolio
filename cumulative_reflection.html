            Iowa State has prepared me in a lot of ways to be a software engineer. In SE 339 - Software Architecture, I learn a lot of
            the different design patterns used and when to use which. This introduced a lot of useful concepts to me. I got to use this knowledge both in that class
            and others for designing a number of projects that have helped my knowledge of how to solve real world problems with technology. It takes not only the knowing that it can be done
            with programing, but it also solidifies the how and makes ideas into the real thing.

            Many of that classes in the SE program after sophomore year deal heavily with groups. CS 309 was my first big group class. It was a new world of being able to work on a large-scale
            project for a whole semester. It showed not only how to break down work and code effectively, but also what makes a good team and how to be a group member. In particular for that class
            not every member was always easy to work and one particular challenge my team faced was that a member effectively disappeared. That gave us the chance to really deal with a major group issue.
            We had to reevaluate the project and reassign work but in the end I think myself and the other members learned a lot from that.

            The class SE 329 - project management I learned a lot about team work and the project life cycle. In the semester I took it the professor really emphasised making projects that
            would contribute to society or provide some worldly use. At first my team worked on creating an application for the health care field. That really made me think about what that
            specific field would need and how we could meet those needs. Another project we made was finding a decent solution to the traveling salesman problem in order to map a path
            for a drone that would be delivering packages like Amazon is said to be working on. Both of these projects definitely helped me understand the need for integrity and professionalism.
            Without the importance of having ethics, so many things could go wrong. In particular it was really important to be honest with the team of what you could get done and if you were having
            issues that you needed help with. It is undoubtedly a cornerstone for effectively building software systems.

            My biggest outside-the-classroom learning experience that ISU helped me with was studying abroad. In the Spring of my sophomore year I got to attend the Hong Kong University of Science And Technology.
            This was truly life changing as it showed me new ways of how to learn and how big the world really is. Aside from the classwork and the different ways that they teach, being in a new country
            opend up my horizons to what the world has to offer and the many things I have yet to learn. It opened up a desire in me to keep traveling and learning all I can with the time I have.

            As I've grown in my development skills I can see myself viewing the world with a technology lens. Looking at systems or hearing of problems and thinking how software could help solve it.
            Having a deeper understanding of coding in general for sure has boosted my confidence in knowing what is possible and what isn't. I would say this has led me to take more risks
            with both the hoping of a new solution working but also to push the boundaries of what I understand and continually morph that to be a better coder.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
           If I could go back I think I would change up my main course work. I took the CprE route and therefore and a much heavier hardware focus. I see now a bit late that this isn't where my passion lies
            and I could probably be a much more effective coder had I made different decisions earlier in my college career.
