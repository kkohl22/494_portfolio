        <p id="cerner">
            In the summer of 2016 I got to intern at Cerner Corporation. Not only was the internship really cool. It was fun
            to be able to contribute to the health care field and see how health informatics is changing with technology
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Team: There eight people offically although it was only me and sometimes my mentor that worked on this project
            <br>4
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            My role:<br> I was assigned to develop an internal tool that would roll back bad data to the last known safe occurance of data. The front end was a Rails app
            and as such I had to learn Ruby and the Rails framework before I could really start. There was also a backend Java server that needed to be modified to support big data groupings
            that I got to work on in that latter half of the internship.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Technologies used:<br> Agile development, Ruby on Rails, Java, MySQL, Postman, Jetbrains IDEs.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            What I learned:<br> this being my first internship meant almost everything was a learning experience. Being in a team that did use Agile and having the daily scrums was really neat.
            Coming in I didn't know Ruby and so I had to learn that in the first week of joining. The biggest things I learned was how coding is done in the professional world and what makes a team
            effective at producing quality code. There were a lot of technologies used but that was nothing new. Being in the job is something that can't be taught in class. Going from the classroom
            to the office was definitely where I learned the most.
