    <h4>Software Engineering Electives</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">SE 417 - Software Testing</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 70px">
        <p>This was a fascinating class taught by a lady who had had a variety of industrial experience from working on underground mapping
        technologies to being part of Nasa in Jet Propulsion lab. The first day she strongly emphasized the need for testing by having us watch rockets blow up
        due to software error that could have been prevented with better testing. I found this class to be really eye opening on the need for the different varieties of testing
        available and deciding on when the testing is enough. I found this class help me a lot as a software engineer by thinking about how to test my code as I write it. I believe that
        this is a better way of programing and therefore has improved my abilities as a software engineer</p>

    <h4>Supplemenrary Electives</h4>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">CprE 288 - Embedded Systems I</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 70px;">This class really laid out the fundamentals of the way computers work. The main thing I took away was how pointers work and how good it is to write code
    for reusability</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">CprE 381 - Computer Organization</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 70px">
    <p >This was perhaps my toughest class. The professor really emphisized figuring things out and not sticking with a "perfect way" but allowed all kinds of
    solutions to receive high marks. This one I also learned a fair amount about working in a small team. Splitting up tasks and getting things done.</p>
        </div>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">CprE 308 - Operating Systems</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 70px">

    <p >This class goes into how an operating system works. From creating a shell to making a process scheduler, this class provided a diverse look at how modern
    computers work. This is one of the few lab classes that did not have partner labs. This was another adapting time to really find solutions on my own and ask the right questions to
    accomplish a task.</p>
