    <h4>Goals</h4>
    <h5>Short term</h5>
    <p>My short term goals are fluid at the moment. Mostly I would like to have a full time job offer before I graduate. I would like to stay in the midwest, preferably to the south. I
    would like to work for a company that whose main product is either software or where software plays a key role. Wherever I end up I would like to either work with front end design and
    scripting or with Java or a similar language. </p>

    <h5>Long term</h5>
    <p>In the long term I would hopefully have a a good job and be secure in my work. I think I would like to move to the manager path of development and not so much the technical aspect.
    I like working with people on a higher level than the exact implementation so I think being a manager would fit that goal. Other goals would be to have a house. Start a family. And serve in a church.</p>

    <h4>General Electives</h4>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">History 201 - Western Civilization</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 70px">This class was fun and interesting all though being history I don't think it applies too much to application. I will say that it tought me what
    are the cornerstones of civilization and what the necessary roles are in society. </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Econ 101 - Macro economics</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 70px">
       <p> This class is the one I would say that tought me the most out of any class at Iowa State. The concepts of diminishing returns and sunk cost impacted the way I thought the most and to
        this day those are concepts that I use in day to day life. It helps me evaluate how to use my time. In software engineering it has helped me decied at what point I should stop refactoring
        in that I can put an hour of work in but the benefit of only putting half an hour of work in would accomplish enough that the extra half hour wouldn't return enough for it to be worth while.
        Game theory was also cool but as much as the others.</p>
    </div>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Psych 101 - Into to Psych</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 70px">
       <p> This class had some impact on my thought process. It taught me that associative memory is the strongest and so often when I study I will use mental pictures or I'll drawl something out
        to help me remember.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Technical Electives</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">N/A  == Not taken yet</p>

    <h4>Software Engineering Electives</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">SE 417 - Software Testing</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 70px">
        <p>This was a fascinating class taught by a lady who had had a variety of industrial experience from working on underground mapping
        technologies to being part of Nasa in Jet Propulsion lab. The first day she strongly emphasized the need for testing by having us watch rockets blow up
        due to software error that could have been prevented with better testing. I found this class to be really eye opening on the need for the different varieties of testing
        available and deciding on when the testing is enough. I found this class help me a lot as a software engineer by thinking about how to test my code as I write it. I believe that
        this is a better way of programing and therefore has improved my abilities as a software engineer</p>
    </div>
    <h4>Supplemenrary Electives</h4>
    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">CprE 288 - Embedded Systems I</p>
    <p style="text-indent: 70px;">This class really laid out the fundamentals of the way computers work. The main thing I took away was how pointers work and how good it is to write code
    for reusability</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">CprE 381 - Computer Organization</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 70px">
    <p >This was perhaps my toughest class. The professor really emphisized figuring things out and not sticking with a "perfect way" but allowed all kinds of
    solutions to receive high marks. This one I also learned a fair amount about working in a small team. Splitting up tasks and getting things done.</p>
        </div>

    <p style="text-indent: 50px;">CprE 308 - Operating Systems</p>

    <div style="margin-left: 70px">

    <p >This class goes into how an operating system works. From creating a shell to making a process scheduler, this class provided a diverse look at how modern
    computers work. This is one of the few lab classes that did not have partner labs. This was another adapting time to really find solutions on my own and ask the right questions to
    accomplish a task.</p>
        </div>

    <h4>Specific stories</h4>
    <p>Its kind of interesting to think of specific stories. Most of my general electives were fairly unrelated to engineering. It would be hard to find a tie of religion or psychology to
    a real application in engineering. I do think they are necessary since they broden our horizons. It also allows us to learn from non-engineering minds and meet and talk with people who have
    think very differently than the way a lot of engineers do.

        One specific story I think of is during my internship last summer I was working on an algorithm to map a large amount of data to a more refined search box. I first got it "working" in a hack
        sense. I then was going back through to clean it and find ways that would make it run faster and cleaner. This was seomthing I could probably spent a week doing but eventually I got to a point
        that the code was pretty good. I was satisfied. I knew that with my current knowledge and general abilites that I would have to spend a ton of time to improve what I had. With the thought process I got from
        Econ 101 I could recognize a good stopping place. This prevented my from being unproductive and ultimately saved the company money by being a more productive engineer. This thoughr process also helps a lot
        when I'm learning something new. I can see that if I'm not understanding or learning fast enough, I should just find a new resource regardless of the time spent and its a sunk cost and
        I should always try to be optimally productive.
